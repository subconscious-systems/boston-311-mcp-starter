# Boston 311 Hackathon Starter

**Build AI agents on City of Boston data in minutes.**

This starter connects you to the [Boston OpenData MCP server](https://data-mcp.boston.gov/mcp) — live access to 311 service requests, MBTA transit data, and Census demographics. You give the agent instructions and tools, and [Subconscious](https://subconscious.dev) handles the reasoning, tool calling, and multi-step execution. Clone, install, run.

---

## Getting Started

**1. Clone and install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subconscious-systems/boston-311-mcp-starter.git
cd boston-311-mcp-starter
npm install
```

**2. Add your API key**

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and paste your Subconscious API key ([get one free here](https://subconscious.dev/platform)).

**3. Run**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — you're live. Click one of the example prompts or type your own question about Boston 311 data.

## What You Get

- **Live city data** — the Boston MCP server is pre-connected. Ask about 311 cases, neighborhoods, SLA performance, complaint types, and more.
- **Streaming agent UI** — watch the agent think, call tools, and build its answer step-by-step.
- **Built-in tools** — web search, calculator, and web reader are included alongside the Boston MCP.
- **One file to extend** — add your own tools (MCP servers, custom functions, or platform tools) in `lib/tools.ts`.

## Next Steps & Ideas

### Add your own tools

Open `lib/tools.ts` — you'll see the Boston MCP, web search, and two utility tools. Add yours below them:

```ts
// Connect another MCP server
{ type: "mcp", url: "https://your-server.com/mcp" }

// Or add a custom function tool (implement the handler in app/api/tools/route.ts)
{ type: "function", name: "MyTool", description: "...", url, method: "POST", ... }
```

### Ideas to build

- **311 Case Monitor** — track open cases past their SLA deadline and surface the worst offenders
- **Neighborhood Report** — generate a plain-English weekly digest for any zip code
- **Equity Analyzer** — compare response times across neighborhoods to find disparities
- **Voice-Powered Reporter** — let residents report issues hands-free
- **Multi-Agent Pipeline** — build a 311 data agent + a consumer agent that acts on it (calendar blocks, Slack alerts, email digests)
